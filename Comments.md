Best Practices
Be concise and clear.
Write comments that are easy to understand and directly related to the code.

Keep comments up-to-date.
Remove outdated comments and update them as code changes.

Avoid redundant comments.
Do not state the obvious; focus on intent, reasoning, and non-trivial details.

Use tags consistently.
Always prefix comments with the appropriate tag for visibility in Better Comments.

Document public APIs and complex logic.
Prioritize commenting on interfaces, exported functions, and intricate algorithms.
